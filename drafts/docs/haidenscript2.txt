9:26 Haidenisa ye still mlg
9:26 ZoomTen ye
it's like
once u heer da theme of haid-kun
ur gonna get rekt m8
especially when ur close to his bae
XD
9:31 Haidenisa LOL HE SHOULD APPEAR WHENEVER YOU GET CLOSE
or like it gives you a warning then if you get any closer you get instarekt
then if you actually manage to beat him his gf comes in and rekts you LOL
9:32 ZoomTen LOOOOOOL
OH MY GOD LOL
*she's there randomly*
*walks up and talks to her*
*wild haiden appears*
"gr"
9:32 Haidenisa "the"
9:32 ZoomTen LOL
*battle*
*insta-rekt*

BUT WHAT IF PLAYER WAS NOT KILL?
9:33 Haidenisa "Haiden sent out 'GET'"
"Haiden sent out 'REKT'"
"Haiden sent out 'YOU'"
"Haiden sent out 'FOCKIN'"
"Haiden sent out 'SKRUB'"
9:33 ZoomTen LOOOOOOOL
The 6th one is named "THE"
9:35 Haidenisa how about all the pokemon are level one then the sixth one is like level 55,555 and insta rekts you LOL
9:36 ZoomTen LOL
YES
But I think the levels go up to 255
9:36 Haidenisa "Haiden sent out 'NATSU DRAGNEEL'"
9:36 ZoomTen LOL
9:36 Haidenisa no
lvl 55,555
LOL
hack'd
that way it's impossible to defeat him B)
9:37 ZoomTen LOL
and then everyone's like WTFHAX
How about if I make it like
When Haiden has his last pokemon
the game automatically sets all of your party pokemon levels to lv.1
So you'll be rekt easily
9:39 Haidenisa LOL
ye
9:39 ZoomTen ;)
9:39 Haidenisa it permanently sets them to level one and you have to start over LOL
9:39 ZoomTen LOOOOL
Haiden's gonna appear once you've beaten the game anyway
and as a secret trainer
9:40 Haidenisa "I WARNED U FOKIN SKRUB"
9:40 ZoomTen LOL
Like I said, Haiden's gonna have like level 1 OP Pokemon
and a Lv.55555 angry Pikachu B)
