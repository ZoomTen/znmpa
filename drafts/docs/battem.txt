  An item can be picked up at the
  Celadon Mansion, which is the "BATTEM". It allows you to battle
  any trainer. Wild Pokemon can also be encountered with this tool. However
  it is glitchy. When used, it asks for a code which would then be
  decoded to get the correct trainer/pokemon ID and instance number/level.
  The format is as follows:
  
  XYYZ
  
  X = Which ID to use? ("I"=internal, "X"=external)
  YY= the trainer ID. It is encoded alphabetically, where "A" = 0.
  Example: $F3 is encoded as "PD", $2A is encoded as "CL"
  Z = If YY is higher than "NI", it's the trainer's instance.
  Lower than that, it's the Pokemon's level divided by 6. It's
  encoded in the same way as YY. 
  
  Example code would be:
  IPDA	=	Internal ID, Trainer $F3, Instance $01 (Theta battle)
  XADC	=	External ID, Trainer $03, Instance $03
  IABA	=	Internal ID, Pokemon $01 (Rhydon), level 6 (A = 1)
  
  This would be useful in cases where battle scripts haven't been implemented
  yet.
