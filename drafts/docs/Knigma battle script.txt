ZILO: I'm ready to fihgt-- wait.. you look like SIGMA. And you also look like KNIRO.. Are you--

KNIGMA: Yes.. we are finally one with each other. You seem surprised.

In the past we had two distinct personalities. Two seperate bodies. We were the queens. We were the masters. Turns out we're really not that distinct. So we decided.. to just become the one. The one queen who shall rule--

ZILO: How the hell did you guys become one? 

KNIGMA: We are already one. We are meant to be one. That's all. But enough of this pointless jibberjabbering. Let us test your worthiness!

ZILO: You guys are oh's, that's why.

KNIGMA: NO! WE ARE NOT OH's!!!

ZILO: Well it's because you guys usually say the craziest of stuff. Whelp, gotta go.

OAK: Congratulations!
