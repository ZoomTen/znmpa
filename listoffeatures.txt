KNOWN BUGS:
- Gaining a level in-battle when battle music isn't in bank 08 (like Theta rematch, Haiden battle, etc.), game may seem to
  freeze, but it's just outputting null. Wait a moment if that happens.
- Lumi and Jinx's custom trainer script is bugged. (Even if you lost, the after battle script is run)
- Bike sprite hasn't been created yet
- Mocha's script is kind of buggy (?)
- The Route 10 trainers aren't active until the player has finished battling Tron Silvumi
  on the Route 9 entrance.
